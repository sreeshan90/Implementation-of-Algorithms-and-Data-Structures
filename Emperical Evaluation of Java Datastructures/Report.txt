Comparison between:

1. LinkedList - List
2. TreeSet - Balanced Tree
3. HashSet - Hashing

Steps:

1. Populated all three data structures with 20000000 elements.
2. Time taken to insert a new element for all three data structures is measured.
3. Time taken to delete a random element present in the data structure is measured.
4. Time taken to find a random element present in the data structure is measured.
